# Port Scanner Language Benchmark

This repository benchmarks a simple TCP port scanner written in C and Python, in order to know which language is best to write such an application for future developments.

Origin of the code:
* C: An old paper named _Coding a TCP Connect Port Scanner: Step by Step_ from truncode security development
* Python: HowTo/Sockets from the official Python wiki at https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sockets
